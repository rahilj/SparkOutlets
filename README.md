SparkOutlets
============

Spark controlled outlet switches
You'll need RF remote controlled outlet switches (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQ2KGB2), optocouplers 
and Spark Core (spark.io) to control upto 5 outlets over the internet.
v_1 uses brute force hack
v_2 will be more elegant with a RF T emulating button press
